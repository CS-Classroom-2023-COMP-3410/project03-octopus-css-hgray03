To preface this reflection, I finished this assignment but totally forgot to push it, my bad. 


This assignment was interesting. I initially assumed it was going to be extremely straightforward, where I would just upload the image provided to chat and it would copy it. However, chat can get close, but it's not very good at getting exactly what you want. It did 90% of the heavy lifting, but in order to get the specifics correct, I had to make some minor changes here and there.
